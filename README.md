        * **Programming game mechanics and UI**
        * **Creating and obtaining graphical assets**
        * Obtaining audio assets
        * **Polishing**
        * Deployment

    * **What points in the development process are suitable for playtesting?**    
    The main points for playtesting are when the basic game mechanics of the level screen are implemented, and when it is visualised. The questions that will be asked are:

        * How do the controls feel?
        * How is the pace of the game?
        * Are there any improvement suggestions?
